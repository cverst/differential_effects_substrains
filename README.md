# differential_effects_substrains
These Python scripts were used for the analysis related to our publication "Differential effects of noise exposure between substrains of CBA mice." This article has been accepted to [Hearing Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/hearing-research). In a future commit the code will be refactored and examples of data and function calls will be included.
